            <h1 style="color:white"class="intro">Everyone loves Spider-Man. And how can we not? Spider-Man entered the
                comic-book universe in issue 15 of Marvel Comics’ “Amazing Fantasy” 
                in August 1962 and has been a major player ever since. The groundbreaking 
                story caught the attention of readers when it featured an awkward, antisocial 
                teenager as its superhero — a description typically associated with sidekicks. 
                But this bold move turned out to be a boon for creator Stan Lee, who touched the 
                hearts of a generation of kids who felt lonely, rejected, or had difficulty making friends. 
                Spider-Man proved that anyone can be a superhero and, even after being around for about 60 years, 
                he’s still as popular as ever.</h1><br>

            <h1 style="color:rgb(186, 225, 231)"class="introhistory">HISTORY</h1><br>

            <h1 style="color:white"class="history">
                Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man is celebrated with exciting 
                events, movie marathons, and trading of collectible comic book issues 
                featuring the superhero. Spider-Man gets the approval of both kids and adults, 
                which makes him so likable and relatable. Kids don their Spider-Man costumes and
                toy web slingers, whereas grown-up enthusiasts wear more elaborate costumes to celebrate
                events and parties.</h1><br>

                <h1 style="color:white"class="history">
                Spider-Man comic books that are rare and collectible are traded and sold. Special issues are also available at some comic book stores.
                With the release of the latest Spider-Man video game, gamers and online streamers host playthrough sessions of the latest and older Spider-Man games. 
                Today is also the day where traditionally we see many masked marauders make news headlines around the world as they attempt to climb walls and buildings — but don’t try this at home 
                (or anywhere for that matter), kids!.</h1><br>
